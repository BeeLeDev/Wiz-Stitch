This website gathers all the previews of items from Wizard101Central. Difference being the filtering is easier.

I tried to deploy the website on GitHub pages, but I get CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and OpaqueResponseBlocking error. I've attempted to solve the issue given a few possibilities, but to no avail. I am beat.
Unless I hosted the website myself, which I don't want to, then this error probably wouldn't be an issue.

Alternate solution:
1. Download zip file.
2. Double-click index.html
