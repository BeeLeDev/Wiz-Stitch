# Wiz-Stitch
I tried to deploy the website on Gtihub pages, but I get CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) due to using Github pages. 
Specifically it is an OpaqueResponseBlocking error.
Unless I hosted the website myself, which I don't want to, then this error wouldn't be an issue.

Alternate solution:
1. Download zip file.
2. Double-click index.html
